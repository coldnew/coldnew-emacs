;;; Development and documentation TODOs:

;; - Make sure I have added all stuff in Brad's Viper additions and
;;   from my collection, then start documenting already. Once there
;;   are even the simplest of docs (a nice keymap), people will have a
;;   far easier time using Vimpulse and so I bet more will contribute.
;;
;; - Folding. This should be implemented as a separate Lisp library
;;   usable for even non-Viper users. Which foldmethods to do first?
;;   I personally only use foldmethod=marker, and even that rarely.
;;
;; - i_C-(I forgot the letter) should do (copy-from-above-command 1)
;;   from misc.el.
;;
;; - Add :set spell / :set nospell that uses flyspell-mode.
;;
;; - Add support for tabs.el, a tabs mode that works sensibly (get it
;;   from Emacs Lisp List).
;;     - Minimum needed: :tabedit, :tabnext, :tabprevious.
;;     - Since I'm emulating Vim, emulate its tab pages feature. So a
;;       tab page should be able to hold one or more buffers.
;;
;; - Add Customize option to let users stop "C-r" from being Redo?
;;
;; - Copy more features from Brad's work in darcs and from vimpact
;;   into Vimpulse.
;;
;; - Doc: look in Google chat log, find description of one-char-off
;;   bug, see if it applies to this or to the not-yet-released
;;   viper-x, and if to this, mention under Bugs.
;;
;; - Doc: list all new keys (and maybe all differences from Viper) in
;;   Usage section.
;;
;; - Doc: describe all new keys in Usage section; can look at Vim
;;   manual for ideas.
;;
;; - Modify how tramp works so it also automatically handles URLs
;;   typed in the netrw syntax, e.g., http:// etc. But first ask tramp
;;   upstream if they could please make those changes themselves.
;;
;; - Improve "CTRL-O" for jumping back in the jumplist and "CTRL-I" for
;;   jumping forwards (for undoing one "CTRL-O"). The global mark ring
;;   is not what I want. I wonder if Emacs' tags functionality allows
;;   a jumplist. I wonder if Viper does tags like nvi does.
;;     - Try code.google.com/p/ejumplist/source/browse/trunk/jumplist.el
;;
;; - On my PC (I run Ubuntu), if you start plain Vim and then press
;;   "CTRL-O" many times, it starts opening recently opened files. Is
;;   that useful? Should Vimpulse have persistent jump table
;;   functionality like that, and if so, should it use recentf or
;;   Vim's .viminfo file or some tag functionality in Emacs? How will
;;   it interact with the fact that in Emacs, it's not traditional to
;;   suddenly close files without warning?
;;
;; - Make sentence movement work like in Vim. I wonder if this can be
;;   done by setting Viper options.
;;     - In Vim, according to :help sentence, end of sentence is:
;;         - ".", "?", or "!"
;;         - then (optionally) one or more """, "'", ")", and "]"
;;           characters
;;         - then a newline, space, or tab.
;;         - A paragraph or section boundary is also a sentence
;;           boundary, but I bet Viper handles that, and if it doesn't,
;;           it should.
;;             - A paragraph begins after each truly empty line (no
;;               whitespace chars on it) or after certain col-1 nroff
;;               macros. A sentence begins after a form feed (^L), or
;;               certain nroff macros, in column 1.
;;             - The characters "{" and "}" sometimes affect paragraph
;;               definitions. See :help paragraph.
;;     - In Viper, on the other hand, I bet sentences are like in vi,
;;       where tabs aren't whitespace, and you need at least two spaces
;;       after the punctuation mark.
;;
;; - Try to get Vimpulse included with upstream Viper; also, ideally,
;;   if you pressed "v" in Viper, Viper would offer to load Vimpulse.
;;   (Likely to happen? Consider that Michael Kifer, the Viper
;;   maintainer, told me he doesn't need Vim keys. Then again, maybe I
;;   could convince him that it's worth it to ship Vim keys, for other
;;   people's benefit. Also, consider that some of the code (like
;;   Operator-Pending mode) addresses problems mentioned in viper.el.)
;;
;; - E-mail ridip <rdp at inthefaith.net> and ask him for his Vimpulse
;;   contribs and his DVORAK stuff.
;;
;; - E-mail to Tromey for upload into ELPA? We'd have to redo this
;;   when a new major version comes out. Or maybe we should just
;;   contribute some auto-ELPA-management code. By the way, should we
;;   move Vimpulse into CVS somewhere?
;;
;; - Maybe merge all feature requests that anyone has ever sent into a
;;   "Feature requests" section here.

;;; Development plans:

;; The design plan for Vimpulse is for it to only emulate features
;; that are in Vim. Therefore, other features do not belong in
;; Vimpulse unless one can get the Vim people to implement those
;; features too.
;;
;; At the same time, Vimpulse should strive for customizability and
;; extensibility, so that the user can modify it just as easily as the
;; rest of Emacs.

;;; Undecided development questions:

;; - In Vimpulse, like in real Vim, "C-r" only does Redo in vi (command)
;;   mode; in Insert mode it does something else. (In Vimpulse that
;;   "something else" is reverse isearch.) Should it do reverse
;;   isearch in Insert mode too?
;;
;; - With some delete commands, Viper shows a message like "Deleted 50
;;   characters" in the minibuffer. Is that annoying?
;;     - Update 1 month later: I hardly notice the message.
;;     - Dear users: Do you think I should disable the message?
;;
;; - I want to allow buffer-switching without using the "C-x" key, since
;;   "C-x b RET" an extremely large amount of times per day is
;;   uncomfortable for my right pinky, which presses RET. There's
;;   already :b, which seems to just invoke `switch-to-buffer'. Is this
;;   right? Is it bad if I make Vimpulse emulate set autowrite=on
;;   then write new multi-buffer code? What should the code's user
;;   interface be like? I really should switch back to Vim for a day,
;;   learn more about how it deals with multiple buffers at once (and
;;   maybe also with tab pages) and emulate whatever of Vim's is most
;;   convenient. What do you think of all the above?
;;     - Update: IIRC, :set hidden lets you switch buffers w/o saving
;;     - Update from Sebastien Rocca Serra: :set wildmenu plus
;;       tab-completion makes :b very pleasant to use when you have
;;       50+ buffers open. Wildmenu is almost like iswitchb or ido.
;;     - I wonder how well that stuff works with just a few buffers open.
;;
;; - Simulate Vim's set virtualedit=onemore option to make "C-x C-e"
;;   possible without first advancing to next line?
;;
;; - Would it be bad to edit users' .viminfo files without asking
;;   permission, or should some variable have to be customized on to do
;;   such a thing?
;;
;; - Is there any need to implement Vim's new
;;   [count]dk-can-go-past-top-of-file-without-error functionality (to
;;   me, no need) or any related functionality?
;;
;; - What to do about XEmacs? It doesn't ship with woman. I wonder
;;   if woman is in some XEmacs package?
