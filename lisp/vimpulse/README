;;; Usage:

;; To use Visual mode, press "v" in vi (command) mode. Then use the
;; motion commands to expand the selection. Press "d" to delete, "c"
;; to change, "r" to replace, or "y" to copy. You can use "p" to
;; paste. For Line selection, press "V" instead of "v"; then you can
;; copy and paste whole lines. For Block selection, press "C-v"; now
;; you can copy and paste the selected rectangle. In Block selection,
;; you may use "I" or "A" to insert or append text before or after the
;; selection on each line.
;;
;; Other features:
;;
;; Vimpulse supports text objects: "daw", "daW", "das", "dap", "dab",
;; "daB", "da(", "da[", "da{", "da<", "da"", "da'", as well as "diw",
;; "diW", "dis", etc. To change an object: "caw", "cas", etc. To yank
;; it: "yaw", "yas", etc. To select it: "vaw", "vas", etc.

;; The documentation that comes with Vim -- which is online at
;; http://vimdoc.sf.net/ -- may also be helpful.
;;
;; Tips:
;;
;; - Vimpulse makes "C-r" run Redo in command mode, but you can
;;   still get reverse isearch by pressing "C-s" and then "C-r".
;;
;; - To change the color of search, add something like the following
;;   to .emacs:
;;
;;       (set-face-foreground isearch nil)
;;       (set-face-background isearch "lightgoldenrod2")
;;
;; - To change the color of Visual mode (`zmacs-region' in XEmacs):
;;
;;       (set-face-background 'region "blue")
