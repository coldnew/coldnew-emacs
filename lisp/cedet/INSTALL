CEDET: Collection of Emacs Development Environment Tools

CEDET is a top-level project containing several individual packages for Emacs,
including:

   EIEIO -    CLOS layer for Emacs Lisp
   Semantic - Parser Infrastructure for Emacs
   Speedbar - Everything browser
   EDE -      File manager/ Makefile generator
   SRecode -  Template manager/ code generator
   COGRE -    Connected Graph Editor

REQUIREMENTS:

   The full CEDET suite requires Emacs 23.1 or newer.

   Compilation of CEDET currently requires GNU Make.

INSTALL:

- Byte Compilation

  Byte compilation is done by entering the top directory and calling

    make

  If you want to byte-compile with a specific Emacs version, use

    make EMACS=<Emacs binary>

  CEDET is designed to be used 'in-place', so you do *not* have to
  call 'make install' afterwards.

- Documentation

  By default, info files containing the CEDET documentation will be
  generated through the above 'make' call and put into

    <CEDET-TOPDIR>/doc/info

  where they will be automatically made known to Emacs when CEDET is
  loaded (so usually, you can stop reading here).  Like the EMACS
  variable above, you can specify binaries for makeinfo and
  install-info, as well as the location for the generated info files,
  by using the 'MAKEINFO', 'INSTALL-INFO' and 'INFODIR' variables,
  respectively.  Note that if you use another INFODIR than the
  default, you have to make sure that they are found by Emacs
  yourself.  Additionally, if writing into your custom INFODIR
  requires special permissions, you'll have to call

    make install-info

  manually as root or via sudo.

- Build Issues

  If running MAKE fails due to other issues such as bad loaddef files,
  custom-autoload or incomprehensible run time errors during a byte
  compilation, do a

    make clean-all

  and try again. If you're running the development version from bzr,
  you can also do

    bzr revert
    bzr clean-tree
    bzr clean-tree --ignore

  to get a clean slate of all files (deleting all new files you've
  created and all changes you've made, of course).

  If you're getting error messages about Makefiles that have to be
  regenerated, or maybe this regeneration is triggered automatically
  and it fails, you can always enforce the current Makefiles by
  updating their timestamps through

    make touch-makefiles

- Install CEDET into your Emacs init files (.emacs):

  You only have to load the cedet-devel-load.el file that ships with
  the CEDET development version. You should place the `load-file'
  command near the beginning of your init file, otherwise parts of
  CEDET like EIEIO might already be loaded. For more details on any
  topic, see the info file common/cedet.info.

-----------
;; Load CEDET.
;; See cedet/common/cedet.info for configuration details.
;; IMPORTANT: For Emacs >= 23.2, you must place this *before* any
;; CEDET component (including EIEIO) gets activated by another 
;; package (Gnus, auth-source, ...).
(load-file "/home/user/cedet/cedet-devel-load.el")

;; Add further minor-modes to be enabled by semantic-mode.
;; See doc-string of `semantic-default-submodes' for other things
;; you can use here.
(add-to-list 'semantic-default-submodes 'global-semantic-idle-summary-mode t)
(add-to-list 'semantic-default-submodes 'global-semantic-idle-completions-mode t)
(add-to-list 'semantic-default-submodes 'global-cedet-m3-minor-mode t)

;; Enable Semantic
(semantic-mode 1)

;; Enable EDE (Project Management) features
(global-ede-mode 1)

OTHER OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

   You may also need to download some of the following files for more
   obscure features.
   
   To use Exuberant CTags to parse files:
   http://ctags.sourceforge.net/

   To use GNU Global integration:
   http://www.gnu.org/software/global

   To use ID Utils integration:
   http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/

   To use CScope integration:

   To use the JavaScript parser on older Emacsen you will need
   javascript-mode.el (this only applies to version 23.1; version 23.2
   and newer will have it included):
   http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/JavaScriptMode

   To use COGRE with Graphviz Dot integration:
