                 Welcome in Xrefactory exercise project!

  1.)  The basic hot-keys you need to know are: F6 which brings you to
  the definition of a symbol, and F5 which brings you back.

  2.)  With  this knowledges you  can browse demonstration  files. Put
  cursor on a function name, say  'completions', and press F6 to go to
  completion's examples.

  At the  first invocation Xrefactory will  ask you for  creation of a
  new  project.   You  should   answer  'yes'  (create  new  project).
  Xrefactory will then pose you few  questions, if you do not know the
  answer, press <return> to select the default value.
