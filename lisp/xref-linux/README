**********************************************************************

In order to install Xrefactory on your machine just type:

    sh ./xrefsetup

This script will guide you  through the installation of Xrefactory and
will introduce its main functions.

If  you  like Xrefactory  and  you  are  super-user, you  can  install
Xrefactory  into  system  directories  by running  'sh  ./xrefinstall'
script.  This  will make  Xrefactory available for  all users  on this
machine.   However,  this  script  does  not  guide  you  through  the
Xrefactory features.

**********************************************************************

In following text XREFDIR denotes the directory where you have untared
the  Xrefactory  distribution (it  is  not  an environment  variable).
Substitute this  directory for XREFDIR  in the following text  and put
lines:

	(setq exec-path (cons "XREFDIR" exec-path))
	(setq load-path (cons "XREFDIR/emacs" load-path))
	(load "xrefactory")

  to your ~/.emacs file.

It  is  done. It  is  highly recommended  that  you  work through  the
tutorials     in     the     files     'XREFDIR/jexercise/Index.java',
'XREFDIR/cexercise/index.c'  and  'XREFDIR/cppexercise/index.cpp'.  To
start  the   tutorial  just  open  mentioned  files   and  follow  the
instructions written there.

Xrefactory uses  F3-F8 functional hot-keys.  It  is highly recommended
that you keep this binding during the tutorials and initial evaluation
of Xrefactory.  Later, you can redefine key bindings either by editing
xrefactory.el file or by adding the line:

    (defvar xref-key-binding 'none)

to your  .emacs file  BEFORE loading of  "xrefactory" file.  This line
prevents Xrefactory  from binding its  functions to hot  keys allowing
you to define your own keys.


**********************************************************************
*                         .xrefrc option file                        *
**********************************************************************

Xrefactory supports  multiple projects.  Options for  all projects are
maintained in a single  configuration file.  The default configuration
file  name  is .xrefrc  ('_xrefrc'  under  MS-Windows).  This file  is
usually placed in your home directory.

Each  invocation of xref  reads the  .xrefrc configuration  file.  The
file  contains xref  command  line switches  mainly specifying  source
files,   include   directories   (    -I   option   ),   and   default
macro-definitions   (  -D   option).   For   Java  it   also  contains
informations about classpaths  (-classpath option), source paths, etc.
For all types of project it  specifies where to store Tag files (-refs
option).

Beginners do  not need  to concern themselves  with the  .xrefrc file.
From  (X)Emacs  you  can  manage   this  file  via  functions  in  the
'Xref->Project'  menu.  These  functions enable  you to  manage simple
projects without needing to manually edit the .xrefrc file.



**********************************************************************
*             Using recipe files from project built.                 *
**********************************************************************


For large and complex projects  it may be difficult to specify options
like -D and -I common for  all files in the project. For example files
from one subdirectory may use different include directories than other
files. Xrefactory offers a possibility to specify command line options
for each file separately.  You  can specify a "recipe" file containing
file specific  options for each  single file of the  project.  Putting
the  option -recipe  <recipefile> into  your project  will  cause that
Xrefactory reads given recipe file  and is using file specific options
in addition to general project options.

Xrefactory offers  an automatic way  to generate recipe file  from the
build of  your project.   If you build  your project using  the script
'xref-recipe-make <file> <pars>' instead of the standard 'make <pars>'
command,  than your  project  will  be build  and  all invocations  of
compiler together with  used command line options will  be stored into
the  <file>.   This  file is  directly  usable  as  a recipe  file  by
Xrefactory.


**********************************************************************
*         Creating and Maintaining Cross Reference File              *
**********************************************************************

Creating and updating of Tags  is performed directly from the (X)Emacs
editor. From the command line you can also create and update Tags with
the xref  command and appropriate  options.  In order to  maintain Tag
files your  .xrefrc file  needs to be  correctly set. For  example, in
order to create a Tag file for the project "toto" type:

    xref -p toto

In order to update Tags for project "toto" type:

    xref -update -p toto


If you feel  that the generated cross-references are  not correct, you
can  invoke  xref  with   '-debug'  or  '-errors'  options,  producing
respectively  a full  trace of  the execution  and all  error messages
produced during the parsing. If the '-nobrief' option is present, then
the resulting Tag file also  contains informations in a human readable
form.

NOTE:  On-line editing macros  re-parse the  currently edited  file in
order to  have fresh  references for  this file. There  is no  need to
update  the   tag  file  "all   the  time"  while  editing   only  one
file. However, on-line editing macros  do not save the new references,
so you should refresh the Tag file when you finish editing each source
file.


**********************************************************************
*        Creating and Maintaining HTML Documentation with xref       *
**********************************************************************

The easiest  way to create HTML from  all of the files  in the current
directory is to type the command:

  xref -html -htmlroot=${HOME}/HTML *.c *.cpp *.java

Generating HTML in this way is best for small, simple projects.  Other
available command line options are described in the xref manual page.


    **************************************************************

Using recipe.

If you can build  your project using 'make' then it is  a good idea to
create a 'recipe' file describing your project and to use this file to
generate correct  documentation. You can  create a recipe  by invoking
the  command 'xref-recipe-make'  instead of  the standard  'make'. The
'xref-recipe-make' is a simple  shell wrapper building the project and
memorizing compilation options into an Xrefactory recipe.

For example, following suite of  commands will build and generate HTML
documentation for xpdf project.

    cd ~/xpdf-2.02pl1
    make clean
    xref-recipe-make /tmp/recipe
    xref -html -htmlroot=${HOME}/HTML -recipe /tmp/recipe


    **************************************************************

Generating HTML repeatedly for the same project.

For projects  where you generate  HTML repeatedly, you may  place your
project  options into  the .xrefrc  file and  cross references  may be
stored in  a separate "Tag" file.  You can then reuse  options and Tag
file to update HTML form of your project.

If  you  have created  your  .xrefrc  from  within (X)Emacs,  all  the
necessary  options  should be  present.   For  more information  about
format of .xrefrc file please see  the xrefrc manual page.  Here is an
example defining a  project named 'toto'. The source  is stored in the
directory ${HOME}/src/toto.

-----------------------------------------------------
[toto]

  ${HOME}/src/toto              // directory containing sources

  -refs=${HOME}/Xrefs/toto
  -refalphahash
  -htmlroot=${HOME}/HTML
  -htmltab=4 

-----------------------------------------------------

After creating  the above .xrefrc file  you will need to  create a Tag
file. This is done with the following command:

  xref -p toto

and then create HTML using the command:

  xref -smartHtml -p toto

This should  read all source  files and produce resulting  HTML forms.
Output  files  are  stored  in  file  hierarchy  under  the  directory
${HOME}/HTML.

You can update  Tag files by re-parsing only  modified files using the
-update option of xref.

    xref -update -p toto


**********************************************************************
*                  Cross references in HTML format                   *
**********************************************************************

Generated HTML form contains  cross-references where each reference is
represented  by file  name  and line  number  with additional  special
informative characters.   A '+' character after the  line number means
that the  corresponding line contains multiple references  of the same
symbol.   Special  prefix  characters  designate  reference  types  as
follows:

 '*'  definition references,
 '+'  declaration references,
 '.'  address references (&x for example) and
 ','  l-value references (x=1; for example).




**********************************************************************
*                  Using Xrefactory Editing Macros                   *
**********************************************************************

There  are macros  available for  manipulating .xrefrc  and  Tag files
directly from  (X)Emacs.  They also  permit you to browse  source code
interactively and provide access to several refactorings.  Intelligent
code  completion is  also  available.  All  editing  functions can  be
accessed through 'Xref' item of (X)Emacs's menu bar.  To get help on a
particular function, type
  "C-h k" 
 (control h  and then k)  and then invoke  the menu item  in question.

**********************************************************************
*            Standard Xrefactory key-binding for Emacs/XEmacs        *
**********************************************************************

Xrefactory  key binding  under Emacs  can  be either  global (for  all
modes) or local  (only under C and Java modes).   You can switch among
those  possibilities  by setting  the  "xref-key-binding" variable  to
'global or 'local before loading  "xrefactory" file.  You can also set
this variable to  'none, in this case Xrefactory's  functions will not
be bound to keys.

Xrefactory's standard key binding is:

F8      - Completion of identifiers. Info on symbols.
F7      - Delete an xrefactory window.
F6      - look for cross-references of the selected identifier, 
          push those references onto stack,
          and go to the definition.
F5      - pop last cross-references pushed by F6, 
          go to the position from where those references were pushed.
F4      - go to the next reference of the top symbol pushed by F6.
F3      - go to the previous reference of the top symbol pushed by F6.

C-F8    - compile & run. Invoke last compilation and run of program.
C-F7    - show symbol and references on the top of reference stack
C-F6    - push and list references of the selected identifier
C-F5    - repush lastly poped references
C-F4    - move to the next reference of selected symbol, no pushing.
          After a compilation move to the next error message.
C-F3    - move to the previous reference of selected symbol, no pushing.
          After a compilation move to the previous error message.

Under  (X)Emacs xref  macros  can  also be  invoked  by selecting  the
appropriate item from the 'Xref' menu on the menu bar.  Another way of
invoking   an  Xrefactory   command  is   the  key   combination  
  'M-x xref-<command_name>'.

Xrefactory  may  display several  dialog  windows  while invoking  its
functions. In those windows a  particular key bindings may be defined.
Usually the '?' key displays  simple help information aboul local keys
available.  In general you can  inspect the definition (or Javadoc) of
any highlighted symbol using  the 'mouse1' or 'mouse2' buttons.  Also,
'mouse3'   button    pops   up   a   menu    listing   all   available
functions. Informations shown  in those windows may be  wider than the
current window and  if so will be truncated.  If  this happens you can
scroll those windows left and  right using Shift-left (Shift with left
arrow) and Shift-right key combinations.

Xrefactory also binds the 'Shift-mouse1' and 'Shift-mouse2' buttons to
a function  parsing the file name  pointed to by the  mouse cursor and
will open it.  It is useful  if you need to visit files mentioned (for
example) in your compilation or run report.


**********************************************************************
*                         Smart Browsing Mode                        *
**********************************************************************

When you  wish to move  to the definition  of a symbol pointed  by the
cursor, Xrefactory first  has to "resolve" the symbol.   It means that
Xrefactory needs to know attributes  of the symbol such as whether the
symbol is  a macro, a  method or  a field; it  needs to know  types of
parameters for an  overloaded method, class where it  is defined, etc.
There are two ways how Xrefactory can determine symbol attributes. The
first way is  to parse the currently edited  buffer (together with all
includes) and to get the  attributes during the parsing.  We call this
way  a "standard  browsing  mode". The  second  way is  to scan  cross
reference file and  to look for the reference  refering to the current
cursor position.  Once having  the reference, the cross-reference file
contains all  necessary informations to  determine the symbol  and its
attributes.  This second way we call a "smart browsing mode".

User can  freely switch between  both modes using  a menu item  in the
main  Xrefactory  menu.   Both  browsing  modes  leads  to  equivalent
resolution, they  differ only in time  performances. Standard browsing
mode takes time proportional to the size of the edited file and to the
size of included headers.  Smart browsing mode takes time proportional
to  the size  of one  cross-reference file.   The smart  browsing mode
requires that references  are up to date, so it  requires an update of
references before the first browsing action.

All in  all the Smart  browsing mode is particularly  advantageous for
understanding large  projects which are not  under active development.
In such  case, update  of references takes  zero time (project  is not
modified) and scanning of references is very fast compared to the time
required for parsing a buffer (especially in C++).



**********************************************************************
*                         Filtering References                       *
**********************************************************************

If you invoke a function producing  list of all usages of a symbol you
will receive  a list of all  references of the  given symbol. Pressing
numeric  keys  a filter  is  applied causing  that  only  some of  the
references are  shown.  There  are 4 filter  levels available  for the
moment.   Applied filters  differs depending  on the  type  of browsed
symbol.

For a variable (or field) the levels are:

Level 3: only definition and declarations are shown. 
Level 2: as level 3 plus l-value usages. 
Level 1: as level 2 plus usages when address of the variable is got. 
Level 0: all references. 

If the browsed symbol is a type name (struct, enum, typedef ...)  then
the filter levels are:

Level 3: Only definitions and declarations are shown.
Level 2: as level 3 plus  usages in the EXTENDS and IMPLEMENTS clauses
         (meaningful only for Java)
Level 1: as level 2  plus all usages  in the top level  scope (global
         vars and function  definitions). This can be used  to see all
         the functions working with a particular type.
Level 0: all references are shown.

The default is Level 0.


**********************************************************************
*                          Symbol resolution                         *
**********************************************************************

Xrefactory provides full  name  lookup when you   decide to  browse  a
symbol. However, there may be situations when the symbol is ambiguous.
This can happen, for example,  in the C language if   a macro body  is
expanded in different contexts.  Ambiguity  is seen frequently in Java
and C++ programs when using virtual methods.  In this case it is often
undecidable which method will be invoked at run time.

In both cases Xrefactory offers manual resolution of symbols. A dialog
with  a  listing of  possible  symbols  appears.  The  dialog contains
symbols    and  classes   where those     symbols   are defined    (or
inherited). Each line of the list corresponds to a class of references
which will   be optionally  pushed to  the  reference  stack.  You can
select  the classes you wish  to browse using  either the middle mouse
button or   the 'Ins'   key.  You  can   then push  all  the  selected
references to the  top of the reference stack  (by  pressing return or
through a popup menu).  In C  a symbol is  identified only by its name
and category.  In Java and C++ a symbol is identified by its name, its
profile and the class where it is defined (or used).

For example let's take a simple program:

ln 1: import java.awt.*;
ln 2: class MyFrame extends Frame {
ln 3:     public void fun() {
ln 4:         addNotify();
ln 5:         FileDialog fd = new FileDialog(this);
ln 6:         fd.addNotify();
ln 7:         Window x = new Window(this);
ln 8:         x.addNotify();       // <- cursor on addNotify
ln 9:     }
ln10: }

and imagine  that you browse the  addNotify symbol on the  line 8.  In
this case Xrefactory displays the following screen:

== addNotify()
       -/-      *Component
       -/-        +- *Container
+ >>   -/1            +- *Window
+      -/-                +- *Dialog
+      -/-                |   +- *FileDialog
+      -/-                +- *Frame
       -/1                    +- MyFrame

In  this screen  you can  see that  you are  browsing  the 'addNotify'
method with no arguments.  Then  you see the classes where this symbol
is defined and  used.  Numeric columns inform you  about the number of
definition/usages indexed  in Tag file.   The classes are  ordered and
indented, so  they form a  subtree of the inheritance  hierarchy.  The
'+' in  the first column indicates the  currently selected application
classes, you can  toggle between space and '+'  using the middle mouse
button.  If  you now  finish the selection,  all references  where the
addNotify() method  is applied to  the classes Window,  Frame, Dialog,
and  FileDialog will  be pushed  on the  reference stack.   By default
Xrefactory selects all classes that  may contain the definition of the
invoked method (note that there  can be several functions invoked at a
single place of code because of virtual methods).

NOTE! The printed class hierarchy  is not exhaustive. It contains only
references  which  were  loaded  when  your  sources  was  indexed  by
Xrefactory.   It  will  not  contain  classes from  your  .jar  (.zip)
archives, which  were not loaded during  the indexing! If  you wish to
load a complete .jar archive you have to add it to the input files.

FILTERING:  There  may be  methods  of the  same  name  which are  not
displayed  on  default  screen.   You  can  access  those  symbols  by
decreasing the filter level.  There are three filtering levels:

Level 2: Shows symbols with the same name and profile as browsed symbol
         and  applied on  a  class related  (via  inheritance) to  the
         browsed symbol.
Level 1: All Symbols with the same profile no depending on application
         class are shown.
Level 0: All symbols of the same name no matter the profile and class
         are listed.



**********************************************************************
*                        Some Useful Hints                           *
**********************************************************************

1.) Program comments.

       Important  references can  be lost  in  temporarily "commented"
pieces   of  code.    In  order   to  avoid   this,  use   the  option
-allowprogramcomments together with  so called 'program commentaries'.
With  this  option,   Xrefactory  recognizes  three  special  'program
commentary' lexems '/*&', '&*/' and '//&'.  When processing the source
file those lexems  are ignored (meaning they do  not cause these parts
of  the program  to  be seen  as  comments during  the parsing).   For
example:

        void fun(int i) {
            //& printf("entering fun(%d)\n",i);
            ...
            /*& printf("leaving fun(%d)\n",i); &*/
        }

the  occurrences  of  the  variable  'i' in the 'printf' calls will be
included into cross-references (and so renamed, ...), even  when  they
are commented for standard compilers.

    **************************************************************

2.)   "Fast update" versus "Full Update" versus "Create".

    Xrefactory offers you two ways to update the cross-reference file.
The  fast update  ('-fastupdate' option)  will update  only references
from input files modified since  the last fast update (or update).  In
case  of C  programming  language,  the fast  update  does not  update
references from header files (even  if header was modified).  The full
update ('-update'  option) will process  all files modified  since the
last full  update plus  all files depending  on modified  files.  Full
update  proceeds also  references from  header files.   Usually source
browsing does  not require a  full update.  However, before  a serious
source modification  (for example before renaming a  global symbol) or
when you need to  be sure to visit all usages of  a global symbol, you
should do a full update of all cross-references.
	After a large  number of Updates the Tag file  may become large as
it contains  also few informations  which can't be removed  when based
only  on partial  information about  project. This  happens  mainly to
class  hierarchy informations  in  Java.  It  is  then recommended  to
re-Create the Tag file from time  to time.  Also in case that you feel
that your Tag file is not correct  (or if it is corrupted in some way)
recreate the Tag file from scratch.


    **************************************************************
                         Hints for C/C++ users
    **************************************************************


3.) replace "#if 0" by "#if ZERO"
	If you  are using the  '#if 0' command  to remove a piece  of code
from the compilation, we strongly recommend to replace it by a command
'#if ZERO', where  ZERO is an undefined macro.   You will then include
the  '-DZERO' in  your '.xrefrc'  file.  In  this way  Xrefactory will
process  these pieces of  code and  the references  will not  be lost.
Operations  like renaming  will also  apply to  references  from those
parts of code, what is what you need.

    **************************************************************

4.) reduce usage of "#else"
    It is  recommended that you  refrain from using the  #else clause.
The main reason  is that to correctly process  source containing #else
you  need at  least two  passes. However,  if you  use  two consequent
positive #ifs, and then a clever initial macro settings you can handle
the  totality of code  within a  single pass  and save  a considerable
amount of time.

    **************************************************************

5.) reduce usage of anonymous struct/union
    It  is common  practice in  C  to use  anonymous struct/unions  in
combination with typedef, for example defining an integerPair type as:

  typedef struct {
    int x,y;
  } integerPair;

However, Xrefactory uses the name of the structure (union) to identify
and link together structure records  from different compilation units.
In  the case  of  an  anonymous  structure,  Xrefactory generates   an
internal name  based  on the position   (in the  source   code) of the
definition.   In this   way    all references,  even    from different
compilation units, which use the same definition  from the same header
file can be linked together.  Unfortunately, if  you modify the header
file  and  make  the  definition  occur at  a  different  position all
existing  references to this structure  will be lost.  References will
be lost until the next  "Full update  of Tag  file".  However, if  you
name the  structure, Xrefactory  can use this  name  to link structure
references together, so references will not be dependent upon position
and will not need to be updated so often.   For this reason it is much
more convenient to always name  structures, even if  you never use the
name.  So continuing our example it would be better to write:

  typedef struct integerPair {
    int x,y;
  } integerPair;

    **************************************************************

6.) Browsing programs with complex pre-processing constructions.
      Xrefactory  contains an  integrated C  pre-processor and  has no
problem browsing within CPP constructions. For example, let's take the
situation:

 1: void panic(int retcode) { exit(retcode); }
 2:
 3: #define _set_ver(xxx) xxx
 4:
 5: #define panic _set_ver(panic)
 6:
 7: main() {
 8:   panic(1);
 9: }

    Now, if you wish to find the 'panic' function called from the line
8, you  position the cursor  on the 'panic'  symbol on the line  8 and
call the  "push this symbol and goto  definition" Xrefactory function.
The  cursor will  be moved  to the  line 5  on the  definition  of the
'panic' macro.  Then you can move  the cursor on the invocation of the
'_set_ver' on  the same line and  call the "push this  symbol and goto
definition" function once more time.   The cursor will be moved to the
definition  of the  '_set_ver' macro.   Here you  can see  that  it is
directly the parameter of the '_set_ver' macro which is invoked as the
function  you are  looking for.   However,  now, if  you position  the
cursor on the 'xxx' symbol  and call Xrefactory, nothing will happened
as 'xxx' is just a macro argument (its definition is on the same line)
.   You need  to  go back  to the  line  5 (using  "pop symbol"),  and
position  the cursor  on  the  'panic' symbol  inside  the macro  body
(inside the '_set_ver(panic)' string)  and finally call the "push this
symbol and goto definition" at this  symbol. This will move you to the
definition of the 'panic' function (line 1).

    **************************************************************

7.) Symbol retrieval in header files.
    Sometimes Xrefactory is unable to determine the type and origin of
a symbol.   For example,  suppose that you  are editing a  header file
'toto.h' containing the single line:

  1: static int toto()  {return TOTO; }

Further  suppose that  in all  your  source files  'toto.h' is  always
included after  a header file defining  the 'TOTO' macro.   If you put
the cursor  on the TOTO invocation  in the 'toto.h' file  and call the
'push this symbol and goto definition' Xrefactory function, the cursor
will not be moved to the definition of the TOTO macro. This is because
TOTO is not  declared when 'toto.h' is processed.   To get around this
problem  first call the  'Update Xref  TAG File'  function and  try to
browse  the symbol TOTO  again.  It  should be  identified now  by its
position.   If  this does  not  work use  the  'push  symbol by  name'
function.  This  function will  look through all  the cross-references
and report all symbols of the  given name. If neither this works (this
may happen, for example, when  browsing only a part of identifier used
in ## cpp  construction), you can use the  function "Search definition
in tags" This function will  look through all the cross-references and
will report all symbols containing the given string.


    **************************************************************

8.) Include <-> included relation browsing
    You  can  inspect  the  file  included by  a  particular  #include
directive by moving  the cursor on the 'include'  word and then invoke
'push this symbol  and goto definition' action. If  you are interested
in browsing all files including the given header file you can open the
header file, go  to the beginning of the file  (beginning of the first
line) and invoke  the 'push this symbol and  goto definition' function
at this place.

9.) Setting up standard macros in .xrefrc file
	If you are  working on a platform which is  not predefined, or you
feel  that predefined  macros are  not correct,  you can  specify your
whole environment  from scratch. Use  the option -undefineall  in your
project  and then put  all compiler  predefined macros.   To determine
predefined   macros  of   your   compiler  you   may   use  the   file
misc/macros.cpp.  After  preprocessinf this  file you will  obtain the
list of the  most common macros and their setting.  For example, on my
linux machine, the command gcc -E -P misc/macros.cpp results in:
-D__cplusplus=1
-D__GNUC__=2
-D__GNUC_MINOR__=96
-D__GNUC_PATCHLEVEL__=0
-Di386=1
-D__i386=1
-D__i386__=1
-Dlinux=1
-D__linux=1
-D__STDC__=1
-Dunix=1
-D__unix=1
-D__unix__=1

*                               TROUBLES                             *
**********************************************************************
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You see a message of form:

:[warning] main.c:160 ,can't open file tin.h

This  means that  the directory  containing  the 'tin.h'  file is  not
specified  in  your include  paths.   You  should  edit your  personal
'~/.xrefrc' file and add there the

    -I directory

option, where directory is the directory containing the 'tin.h' file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
While creating cross references of a file 'myfile.c' you see a message
like:

'myfile.c'
:[warning] stdlib.h:32 ,     can't open file stddef.h

meaning that  the file 'stddef.h',  included from the  standard header
'stdlib.h', was not found. This  can occur when your compiler is using
non standard include  directories. In this case you  have to determine
which directory contains 'stdlib.h'  and add this directory, using the
'-I' option,  into your '~/.xrefrc'  file.  In order to  determine the
include  directory of your  compiler, you  can pre-process  your input
file with your compiler and look for the place where the searched file
was included, i.e. (following our example) type:

    gcc -E myfile.c | grep "stddef.h"

and you will obtain an output in the form:

 #line 1 "/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.7.2.3/include/stddef.h" 1 3

Here you see the directory containing the file in question and you can
now add the line:

    -I /usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/2.7.2.3/include

to your '.xrefrc' file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
While calling code completion you receive the error message:

    '[error] sorry, memory mbMemory overflowed over borne'

The macro-body  memory overflowed. This  probably means that  you have
invoked  the completion  inside  a macro  invocation  with no  closing
parentheses. Just  put a closing parenthesis after  the macro argument
and  call  the completion  again.  If this  does  not  work, read  the
following item.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
You see a message like:

    "[warning] cx_memory resizing required" 

This happens  when the memory which stores  cross references overflows
and  cannot be  resized  anymore.   If this  happens  when calling  an
editing macro  you should probably put the  "-noincluderefs" option in
your .xrefrc option file or to use "-mf<n>" command line option.
