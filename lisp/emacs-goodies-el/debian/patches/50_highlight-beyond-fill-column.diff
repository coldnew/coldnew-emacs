+;;; History:
+;; 
+;; V1.2 2003-09-12 by Peter S Galbraith <psg@debian.org>
+;; - Made checkdoc clean and fixed indentation and parentheses placement.
+;; - Added defgroup; used defface.
+;; - Removed `highlight-beyond-fill-column-in-modes' since it didn't work
+;;   anymore.
+;; - Created `highlight-beyond-fill-column' to use on a single buffer or as
+;;   a hook.
