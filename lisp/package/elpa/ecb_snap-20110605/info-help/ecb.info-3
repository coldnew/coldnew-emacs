11.5.1 How to program a new layout
----------------------------------

If you just want creating a new layout with the standard ECB-windows
like directories, sources, methods, history and speedbar it's is
strongly recommended to define the new layout interactively with the
command `ecb-create-new-layout' (*note Creating a new ECB-layout::).

If you want creating a new layout and if this layout should contain
other special windows than the standard ECB-windows then it's still
recommended to define this layout interactively with
`ecb-create-new-layout' and using the option to give the created
windows user-defined types. For every user defined type you have then
just to program the necessary buffer-set function. For all the details
see *note Creating a new ECB-layout::.

But if you do not like the interactive way (because you are tough and
brave) but you want programming the new layout with Elisp then use the
macro `ecb-layout-define' (the following definition has stripped the
prefix "ecb-" for better indexing this manual):

 -- Macro: layout-define name type doc &rest create-code
     Creates a new ECB-layout with name NAME. TYPE is the type of the
     new layout and is literal, i.e. not evaluated. It can be left,
     right, top or left-right. DOC is the docstring for the new
     layout-function "ecb-layout-function-<name>". CREATE-CODE is all
     the lisp code which is necessary to define the
     ECB-windows/buffers. This macro adds the layout with NAME and
     TYPEto the internal variable `ecb-available-layouts'.

     Preconditions for CREATE-CODE:
       1. Current frame is splitted at least in one edit-window and the
          "column" (for layout types left, right and left-right) rsp.
          "row" (for a top layout) for the special ECB-windows/buffers.
          The width of the "column" rsp. the height of the "row" is
          always defined with the option `ecb-windows-width' rsp.
          `ecb-windows-height'.  Depending on the value of the option
          `ecb-compile-window-height' there is also a compile window at
          the bottom of the frame which is stored in
          `ecb-compile-window'.

       2. All windows are not dedicated.

       3. Neither the edit-window nor the compile-window (if there is
          one) are selected for types left, right and top. For type
          left-right the left column-window is selected

       4. All ECB-advices of the advice-sets
          `ecb-basic-adviced-functions' and
          `ecb-permanent-adviced-functions' are disabled.

     Things CREATE-CODE has to do:
       1. Splitting the ECB-tree-windows-column(s)/row (s.a.) in all the
          ECB-windows the layout should contain (directories, sources,
          methods and history). The split must not be done with other
          functions than `ecb-split-hor' and `ecb-split-ver'! It is
          recommended not to to use a "hard" number of split-lines or
          -rows but using fractions between -0.9 and +0.9! Tip: It is
          recommended to spilt from right to left and from bottom to
          top or with other words: First create the right-most and
          bottom-most special windows!

       2. Making each special ECB-window a dedicated window. This can
          be done with one of the following functions:
             - `ecb-set-directories-buffer'

             - `ecb-set-sources-buffer'

             - `ecb-set-methods-buffer'

             - `ecb-set-history-buffer'

             - `ecb-set-speedbar-buffer'

             - `ecb-set-analyse-buffer'

             - `ecb-set-symboldef-buffer'
          Each layout can only contain one of each tree-buffer-type!

          In addition to these functions there is a general macro:
          `defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer': This macro defines a
          so called "window-dedicator" which is a function registered
          at ECB and called by ECB to perform any arbitrary code in
          current window and makes the window autom.  dedicated to the
          special ecb-buffer at the end. This can be used by third
          party packages like JDEE to create arbitrary ECB-windows
          besides the standard special ecb-windows.

          To make a special ECB-window a dedicated window either one of
          the seven functions above must be used or a new
          "window-dedicator"-function has to be defined with
          `defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer' and must be used
          within the layout-definition.

       3. Every(!) special ECB-window must be dedicated to a buffer as
          described in 2.

       4. CREATE-CODE must work correctly regardless if there is
          already a compile-window (stored in `ecb-compile-window') or
          not (`ecb-compile-window' is nil).

     Things CREATE-CODE can do or can use:
       1. The value of `ecb-compile-window' which contains the
          compile-window (if there is one). Using the values of
          `ecb-compile-window-height', `ecb-windows-width',
          `ecb-windows-height'.

     Things CREATE-CODE must NOT do:
       1. Splitting the edit-window

       2. Creating a compile-window

       3. Deleting the edit-window, the compile-window (if there is
          any) or the ECB-windows-column(s)/row (see Precondition 1.)

       4. Referring to the value of `ecb-edit-window' because this is
          always nil during CREATE-CODE.

     Postconditions for CREATE-CODE:
       1. The edit-window must be the selected window and must not be
          dedicated and not be splitted.

       2. Every window besides the edit-window (and the compile-window)
          must be a dedicated window (e.g. a ECB-tree-window).

Use this macro to program new layouts within your `.emacs' or any other
file which is loaded into your Emacs. After loading the file(s) with
all the new layout-definitions you can use it by customizing the option
`ecb-layout-name' to the appropriate name or with the command
`ecb-change-layout'.

With the function `ecb-layout-undefine' you can remove a layout from
the list of available layouts:

 -- Function: layout-undefine name
     Unbind ecb-layout-function-<NAME> and
     ecb-delete-window-ecb-windows-<NAME> and remove `NAME' from
     `ecb-available-layouts'.

Here is an example for a new layout programmed with `ecb-layout-define':

   (ecb-layout-define "my-own-layout" left nil
     ;; The frame is already splitted side-by-side and point stays in the
     ;; left window (= the ECB-tree-window-column)

     ;; Here is the creation code for the new layout

     ;; 1. Defining the current window/buffer as ECB-methods buffer
     (ecb-set-methods-buffer)
     ;; 2. Splitting the ECB-tree-windows-column in two windows
     (ecb-split-ver 0.75 t)
     ;; 3. Go to the second window
     (other-window 1)
     ;; 4. Defining the current window/buffer as ECB-history buffer
     (ecb-set-history-buffer)
     ;; 5. Make the ECB-edit-window current (see Postcondition above)
     (select-window (next-window)))

This layout definition defines a layout with name "my-own-layout" which
looks like:

11.5.2 All aspects of programming special windows
-------------------------------------------------

ECB offers a flexible programmable layout-engine for other packages to
display their own contents and informations in special ECB-windows. An
example could be a graphical debugger which offers a special window for
displaying local variables and another special window for messages from
the debugger-process (like JDEbug of JDEE(1)).

This section explains all aspects of programming new special windows,
adding them to a new layout and synchronizing them with edit-window of
ECB. This can be done best with an easy example which nevertheless
covers all necessary aspects to be a good example and skeleton for
complex tools (like a graphical debugger) which want to use the
layout-engine of ECB do display their own information.

*IMPORTANT*: See *note tree-buffer:: for a full documentation of the
library tree-buffer.el which can be used for programming a new special
window as a tree!

Here comes the example:

11.5.2.2 The description of the layout-contents
...............................................

The top-left window always displays informations about the current
buffer in the selected edit-window. This window demonstrates how autom.
synchronizing a special window/buffer of a layout with current
edit-window.

The top-right window contains an read-only "action-buffer" and offers
two buttons which can be used with the middle mouse-button to scroll
the edit-window. This is not very senseful but it demonstrates how to
control the edit-window with actions performed in a special
window/buffer of a layout.

(If you have not set a compilation-window in
`ecb-compile-window-height' then the layout contains no persistent
compilation window and the other windows get a little more place).

11.5.2.3 The example code
.........................

Now let have us a look at the several parts of the Elisp-program needed
to program this new example layout. ECB contains a library
`ecb-examples.el' which contains the full working code of this example.
To test this example and to play with it you can load this library into
Emacs (with `load-library' for example) and then calling
`ecb-change-layout' (bound to `C-c . lc') and inserting
"example-layout1" as layout-name. An alternative is calling
`ecb-examples-activate' and `ecb-examples-deactivate'. For details see
file `ecb-examples.el'.

The following steps only contain code-skeletons to demonstrate the
principle. The full working code is available in `ecb-examples.el'.

11.5.2.4 The bufferinfo buffer of the example
.............................................

The name of the bufferinfo buffer:

   (defconst ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name " *ECB buffer info*")

Two helper functions for displaying infos in a special buffer:

   (defun ecb-examples-print-file-attributes (buffer filename)
     (ecb-with-readonly-buffer buffer
       (erase-buffer)
       (insert (format "Bufferinfo for %s:\n\n" filename))
       ;; insert with the function `file-attributes' some
       ;; informations about FILENAME.
       ))

   (defun ecb-examples-print-non-filebuffer (buffer buffer-name)
     (ecb-with-readonly-buffer buffer
       (erase-buffer)
       ;; analogous to `ecb-examples-print-file-attributes'
       ))

For synchronizing the bufferinfo window with the current source-buffer
we first introduce some three options which are very typical for a
special ECB-window which should be synchronized with current buffer in
the edit-area.

The :type of the first two options is essential and *MUST NOT* be
defined differently, because the macro
`defecb-autocontrol/sync-function' (s.b.) and the function
`ecb-activate-ecb-autocontrol-function' (s.b.)  expects exactly these
option-types.

The third one for an own hook running after synchronizing is not
essential but mostly useful for users who wants to do some own stuff.

Here come the three options - for detailled docstrings take a look into
the file `ecb-examples.el':

   (defcustom ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync 'basic
     "*Synchronize the bufferinfo buffer automatically with current edit buffer.

   If 'always then the synchronization takes place always a buffer changes in the
   edit window, if nil then never. If a list of major-modes then only if the
   `major-mode' of the new buffer belongs NOT to this list.

   If the special value 'basic is set then ECB uses the setting of the option
   `ecb-basic-buffer-sync'.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: Every time the synchronization is done the hook
   `ecb-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-hook' is evaluated."
     :group 'ecb-examples-bufferinfo
     :type '(radio :tag "Synchronize ECBs example bufferino buffer"
                   (const :tag "use basic value" :value basic)
                   (const :tag "Always" :value always)
                   (const :tag "Never" nil)
                   (repeat :tag "Not with these modes"
                           (symbol :tag "mode"))))

   (defcustom ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-delay 'basic
     "*Time Emacs must be idle before the bufferinfo-buffer is synchronized.
   Synchronizing is done with the current source displayed in the edit window. If
   nil then there is no delay, means synchronization takes place immediately. A
   small value of about 0.25 seconds saves CPU resources and you get even though
   almost the same effect as if you set no delay.

   If the special value 'basic is set then ECB uses the setting of the option
   `ecb-basic-buffer-sync-delay'"
     :group 'ecb-analyse
     :type '(radio (const :tag "use basic value" :value basic)
                   (const :tag "No synchronizing delay" :value nil)
                   (number :tag "Idle time before synchronizing" :value 2))
     :set (function (lambda (symbol value)
                      (set symbol value)
                      (if (and (boundp 'ecb-minor-mode)
                               (featurep 'ecb-examples)
                               ecb-minor-mode)
                          (ecb-activate-ecb-autocontrol-function
                           value 'ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync))))
     :initialize 'custom-initialize-default)

   (defcustom ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-hook nil
     "Hook run at the end of `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync'.
   See documentation of `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync' for conditions when
   synchronization takes place and so in turn these hooks are evaluated.

   ..."
     :group 'ecb-analyse
     :type 'hook)

Now we define the synchronizing function. *IMPORTANT*: The main
synchronizing function must be defined with the macro
`defecb-autocontrol/sync-function'! See the documentation of this
function for all details.

The following function synchronizes the bufferinfo buffer with the
current buffer of the edit-window if that buffer has changed

See the comments in the code for explanations.

   (defvar ecb-examples-bufferinfo-last-file-buffer nil)

   (defecb-autocontrol/sync-function ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync
       ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync t
     "Synchronizes the buffer-info buffer with current source if changed.
   Can be called interactively but normally this should not be necessary because
   it will be called autom. by the internal synchronizing mechanism of ECB."

     ;; The macro `defecb-autocontrol/sync-function' does a lot for our
     ;; conveniance:

     ;; 1) here we can be sure that the buffer with name
     ;; `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name' is displayed in a window of
     ;; `ecb-frame' because the macro `defecb-autocontrol/sync-function'
     ;; encapsulates automatically the following code within
     ;; `ecb-do-if-buffer-visible-in-ecb-frame' and this macro binds locally the
     ;; variables visible-buffer and visible-window: visible-window:=
     ;; (get-buffer-window ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name) visible-buffer:=
     ;; (get-buffer ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name)

     ;; 2) The macro `defecb-autocontrol/sync-function' automatically takes care of
     ;;    the setting of option `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync' and runs the
     ;;    following code only when the related conditions are true

     ;; 3) The generated function has one optional argument FORCE which can be used
     ;; in the code below.

     ;; 4) The macro `defecb-autocontrol/sync-function' makes this synchronizing
     ;;    function interactive

     ;; For details please read the documentation of
     ;; `defecb-autocontrol/sync-function'!

     ;; synchronize only when point stays in one of the edit-window.
     (when (ecb-point-in-edit-window-number)

       ;; we need the file-name of indirect-buffers too (if the base-buffer is a
       ;; file-buffer), therefore we use `ecb-buffer-file-name' (see the docstring
       ;; of this function)
       (let ((filename (ecb-buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))

         (if (and filename (ecb-buffer-or-file-readable-p filename))

             ;; synchronizing for real filesource-buffers or indirect buffers of
             ;; real file buffers

               ;; Let us be smart: We synchronize only if sourcebuffer has changed
               ;; or if the argument FORCE is not nil
               (when (or force
                         (not (equal (current-buffer)
                                     ecb-examples-bufferinfo-last-file-buffer)))
                 ;; set new last-file-buffer so we can check next time if changed
                 (setq ecb-examples-bufferinfo-last-file-buffer (current-buffer))
                 ;; we display the file-infos for current source-buffer
                 (ecb-examples-print-file-attributes visible-buffer filename))

           ;; what should we do for non file buffers like help-buffers etc...
           (setq ecb-examples-bufferinfo-last-file-buffer nil)
           (ecb-examples-print-non-filebuffer visible-buffer
                                              (buffer-name (current-buffer)))))

       ;; Now lets run the hooks in `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-hook'

     (interactive)
     (ecb-goto-ecb-window ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name))

11.5.2.5 Synchronizing the bufferinfo-buffer automatically
..........................................................

By using the macro `defecb-autocontrol/sync-function' for defining our
synchronizing function we have already registered this function as a
synchronizing function managed by ECB:

The only thing we need is to tell ECB when this function should run -
for this we have already defined the first two options in our example
(s.a.).  ECB offers to functions for

   * `ecb-activate-ecb-autocontrol-function': Activate/start
     synchronizing

   * `ecb-stop-autocontrol/sync-function': Stop synchronizing

It's smart to activate the synchronizing function within the
dedicator-function. See the comment within the following function.

The function which makes the bufferinfo-buffer dedicated to a window
and registers the new special window/buffer at ECB.

   (defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer ecb-examples-set-bufferinfo-buffer
       ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name nil
     "Set the buffer in the current window to the bufferinfo-buffer and make this
   window dedicated for this buffer. Makes the buffer read-only."

     ;; activating the synchronization of the bufferinfo-window:
     ;; `ecb-activate-ecb-autocontrol-function' takes care of the possible
     ;; settings in `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-delay'. Therefore we do
     ;; it here because then changes in ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-delay
     ;; are taken into account each time the bufferinfo buffer is set in the
     ;; layout (after each hiding/showing the ecb-window, each redrawing the
     ;; layout deactivating/activating ECB)
     (ecb-activate-ecb-autocontrol-function ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync-delay
                                            'ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync)

     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-name))
     (setq buffer-read-only t))

This is all what we need for the special bufferinfo buffer. We have
demonstrated already three of the important functions/macros of the
layout-engine API of ECB: `ecb-with-readonly-buffer',
`defecb-autocontrol/sync-function' and
`defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer' (*note The layout-engine API::.
Especially the second macro is a MUST for programming good
synchronizing functions which do not waste CPU-power! We have also
shown how to start/activate a synchronizing function by
`ecb-activate-ecb-autocontrol-function'. Later we will see how to stop
it.

11.5.2.6 The action buffer of the example
.........................................

The name of the action-buffer:

   (defconst ecb-examples-action-buffer-name " *ECB action buffer*")

Two helper functions for creating a readonly action-buffer with a
special local key-map for the middle-mouse-button and two buttons
[prior] and [next]:

   (defun ecb-examples-insert-text-in-action-buffer (text)
     (let ((p (point)))
       (insert text)
       (put-text-property p (+ p (length text)) 'mouse-face
                                                'highlight)))

   (defun ecb-examples-action-buffer-create ()
     (save-excursion
       (if (get-buffer ecb-examples-action-buffer-name)
           (get-buffer ecb-examples-action-buffer-name)

         (set-buffer (get-buffer-create
                       ecb-examples-action-buffer-name))

         ;; we setup a local key-map and bind middle-mouse-button
         ;; see ecb-examples.el for the full code

         ;; insert the action buttons [prior] and [next] and
         ;; make it read-only

         (ecb-with-readonly-buffer (current-buffer)
           (erase-buffer)
           (ecb-examples-insert-text-in-action-buffer "[prior]")
           ;; analogous for the [next] button
           )

         (current-buffer))))

The function which performs the actions in the action-buffer if clicked
with the middle-mouse button onto a button [next] or [prior].

   (defun ecb-examples-action-buffer-clicked (e)
     (interactive "e")
     (mouse-set-point e)
     (let ((line (buffer-substring (ecb-line-beginning-pos)
                                   (ecb-line-end-pos))))
       (cond ((string-match "prior" line)
              (ecb-select-edit-window)
              (call-interactively 'scroll-down))
             ((string-match "next" line)
              ;; analogous for [next]
              ))))

Two conveniance-commands for the user:

   (defun ecb-maximize-action-window ()
     "Maximize the action-window.
   I.e. delete all other ECB-windows, so only one ECB-window and the
   edit-window\(s) are visible \(and maybe a compile-window). Works
   also if the ECB-analyse-window is not visible in current layout."
     (interactive)
     (ecb-display-one-ecb-buffer ecb-examples-action-buffer-name))

   (defun ecb-goto-action-window ()
     "Make the action-window the current window."
     (interactive)
     (ecb-goto-ecb-window ecb-examples-action-buffer-name))

The function which makes the action-buffer dedicated to a window and
registers it at ECB.

   (defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer ecb-examples-set-action-buffer
       ecb-examples-action-buffer-name nil
     "Set the buffer in the current window to the action-buffer
   and make this window dedicated for this buffer."
     (switch-to-buffer (buffer-name (ecb-examples-action-buffer-create))))

We do not need more code for the action buffer. All of the code is
standard emacs-lisp which would also needed if used without ECB.

11.5.2.7 Adding the bufferinfo- and action-buffer to a new layout
.................................................................

Now we add the bufferinfo- and the action-buffer to a new layout of
type top with name "example-layout1":

   (ecb-layout-define "example-layout1" top

     ;; dedicating the bufferinfo window to the bufferinfo-buffer
     (ecb-examples-set-bufferinfo-buffer)

     ;; creating the action-window
     (ecb-split-hor 0.75)

     ;; dedicate the action window to the action-buffer
     (ecb-examples-set-action-buffer)

     ;; select the edit-window
     (select-window (next-window)))

This all what we need to define the new layout. See *note Programming a
new layout:: for more details of the pure layout-programming task.

11.5.2.8 Activating and deactivating new layouts
................................................

Because a set of new special windows integrated in a new layout is
often just the GUI of a complete tool (like a graphical debugger) we
demonstrate here the complete activation and deactivation of such a
tool or at least of the tool-GUI. We decide that the GUI of our example
"tool" needs a compile-window with height 5 lines and the height of the
special windows "row" on top should be exactly 6 lines (normally width
and height of the special windows should be a fraction of the frame,
but here we use 6 lines(2)

Here comes the (de)activation code.

The code for saving and restoring the state before activation (the full
code is available in `ecb-examples.el':

   (defun ecb-examples-preactivation-state(action)
     (cond ((equal action 'save)
            ;; code for saving the state
            )
           ((equal action 'restore)
           ;; code for restoring the state
           )))

The following function activates the GUI of our example tool:

   (defun ecb-examples-activate ()
     "Activate the new layout \"example-layout1\".
   Acivates the function `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync', set
   `ecb-compile-window-height' to 5 and `ecb-windows-height' to 6. The
   preactivation-state is saved and will be restored by
   `ecb-examples-deactivate'."
     (interactive)

     (assert (featurep 'ecb) nil
             "ECB must be loaded!")
     (assert ecb-minor-mode nil
             "ECB must be activated!")
     (assert (equal (selected-frame) ecb-frame) nil
             "The ECB-frame must be selected!")
     (assert (not (ecb-string= ecb-layout-name "example-layout1")) nil
             "The examples-layout1 is already active!")

     ;; saving the state
     (ecb-examples-preactivation-state 'save)

     ;; switch to our prefered layout
     (setq ecb-windows-height 6)
     (setq ecb-compile-window-height 8)
     (let ((ecb-change-layout-preserves-compwin-state nil))
       ;; activating the synchronization of the bufferinfo-window is done in the
       ;; dedicator-function (see `ecb-examples-set-bufferinfo-buffer' for the
       ;; reason). So the synchronizing will be activated implicitly with the
       ;; layout-switch because this redraws the layout and this calls all
       ;; dedicator-functions.
       (ecb-layout-switch "example-layout1")))

This function deactivates the GUI of our example-tool and restores the
state as before activation:

   (defun ecb-examples-deactivate ()
     "Deactivate the new layout \"example-layout1\".
   Stops `ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync' and restore the state
   as before activation."
     (interactive)

     (assert (featurep 'ecb) nil
             "ECB must be loaded!")
     (assert ecb-minor-mode nil
             "ECB must be activated!")
     (assert (equal (selected-frame) ecb-frame) nil
             "The ECB-frame must be selected!")
     (assert (ecb-string= ecb-layout-name "example-layout1") nil
             "The example-layout1 is not active!")

     ;; we stop here the synchronization.
     (ecb-stop-autocontrol/sync-function 'ecb-examples-bufferinfo-buffer-sync)

     (ecb-examples-preactivation-state 'restore)

     (ecb-layout-switch ecb-layout-name))

Now we have all code for the new layout and the new layout-buffers.
The example is ready for use; just load `ecb-examples.el' (s.a.).

---------- Footnotes ----------

(1) JDEE is available at `http://jdee.sunsite.dk/'

(2) You can change the code in the file `ecb-examples.el' to use a
frame-fraction of 0.2 instead of 6 hard lines, just try it!

11.5.3 The wide range of possible layout-outlines
-------------------------------------------------

In the two previous sections *note Programming a new layout:: and *note
Programming special windows:: we have explained in detail how to
program new layouts and how to program new special windows/buffers and
adding them to a new layout.

The intention of this section is to be a summary what are the real
restrictions for a new layout-outline programmed with
`ecb-layout-define'. This is necessary because until now we just
programmed "obvious" layouts, means layout which are in principle very
similar to the standard ones which means one big edit-window and some
special windows "around" this edit-window. This section will show you
that a layout can have also very different outlines.

OK, here are the real restrictions and conditions for a layout
programmed with `ecb-layout-define':
  1. It must have exactly one edit-window regardless of its size. The
     user of this layout can later split this edit-window in as many
     edit-windows as he like.

  2. All other windows created within the CREATE-CODE body of
     `ecb-layout-define' (*note Programming a new layout::) must be
     dedicated to their buffers.

  3. All the dedicated windows must (exclusive!) either reside on the
     left, right, top or left-and-right side of the edit-window. This
     will be defined with the TYPE-argument of `ecb-layout-define'
     (*note Programming a new layout::).

You see, there are only three restrictions/conditions. These and only
these must be fulfilled at layout-programming.

Demonstrating what this really means and how flexible the layout-engine
of ECB really is, can be done best with some "pathological"
layout-outlines. All the following are correct layouts (working code is
added below each layout):

The following is a top layout with three vertical layered special
windows.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   |                                                                |
   |                 Upper special window (a tree-buffer)           |
   |                                                                |
   |----------------------------------------------------------------|
   |                                                                |
   |                 Middle special window (no tree-buffer)         |
   |                                                                |
   |----------------------------------------------------------------|
   |                                                                |
   |                 Lower special window (a tree-buffer)           |
   |                                                                |
   |================================================================|
   |                                                                |
   |                         Edit-area                              |
   |      (can be splitted by the user in several edit-windows)     |
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   |                                                                |
   |                 Compilation-window (optional)                  |
   |                                                                |
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the code for that top layout (all buffers are dummy-buffers):


   ;; The "window dedicator to buffer" functions:

   (defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer ecb-set-usw-buffer
      upper-special-window-buffer-name t
     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "Upper special window")))

   (defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer ecb-set-msw-buffer
      middle-special-window-buffer-name nil
     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "Middle special window")))

   (defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer ecb-set-lsw-buffer
      lower-special-window-buffer-name t
     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "Lower special window")))

   ;; The layout itself:

   (ecb-layout-define "example-layout3" top
     nil

     ;; here we have an edit-window and above one top window which we can
     ;; now split in several other windows. Dependent on the value of
     ;; `ecb-compile-window-height' we have also a compile-window at the
     ;; bottom.

     (ecb-set-usw-buffer)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.33)
     (ecb-set-msw-buffer)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.5)
     (ecb-set-lsw-buffer)

     ;; select the edit-window.
     (select-window (next-window)))

The following is a left-right layout which has six special windows in
the left-"column" and one big special window in the right-"column". For
left-right layouts the left-"column" and the right-"column" have always
the same width.

   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   |             |       |                   |                      |

   |             |       |                   |                      |

   |      |      |       |      windows)     |                      |
   |-------------|       |                   |                      |
   |             |       |                   |                      |
   | Left4       | Left6 |                   |                      |
   |             |       |                   |                      |
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   |                                                                |
   |                 Compilation-window (optional)                  |
   |                                                                |
   ------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is the code for that left-right layout, again with dummy-buffers
(depending to your screen-resolution you will need a quite big value
for `ecb-windows-width', e.g. 0.4):

Here is one of the "window dedicator for buffer"-functions(1):

   (defvar buffer-name-left1 "left1")

   ;; Note that the third argument muts be not nil if the ecb-window should
   ;; display an ecb-buffer of type tree-buffer!
   (defecb-window-dedicator-to-ecb-buffer ecb-set-left1-buffer buffer-name-left1 nil
     (switch-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "Left1")))

Here is the layout-definition itself:

   (ecb-layout-define "example-layout2" left-right
     nil

     ;; here we have an edit-window and left and right two windows each
     ;; with width `ecb-windows-width'. Dependent to the value of
     ;; `ecb-compile-window-height' we have also a compile-window at the
     ;; bottom.

     (ecb-set-left1-buffer)
     (ecb-split-hor 0.66 t)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.75)
     (ecb-set-left4-buffer)
     (select-window (previous-window (selected-window) 0))
     (ecb-split-ver 0.25 nil t)
     (ecb-set-left2-buffer)
     (ecb-split-hor 0.5)
     (ecb-set-left3-buffer)
     (select-window (next-window (next-window)))
     (ecb-set-left5-buffer)
     (ecb-split-ver 0.5)
     (ecb-set-left6-buffer)
     (select-window (next-window (next-window)))
     (ecb-set-right1-buffer))

     ;; select the edit-window
     (select-window (previous-window (selected-window) 0)))

Especially the last example should demonstrate that even very
complicated layouts are easy to program with `ecb-layout-define'.  If
such layouts are senseful is another topic ;-)

(1) The "window dedicators" for all these ecb-windows/buffers are not
explicitly described - they look all like `ecb-set-left1-buffer' - of
course with different buffer-names!

12 Conflicts and bugs of ECB
****************************

This chapter describes what to do when there are conflicts with other
packages and also the known (and currently unfixed) bugs of ECB. If
possible (and in most cases it is possible ;-) then a practicable
solution or workaround is described.

12.1 Conflicts with other packages
==================================

This chapter contains a list of already known conflict between ECB and
other packages and how to solve them - in most cases ECB already
contains a suitable workaround.

That is followed by a general recipe what you can do when you have
detected a conflict between ECB and a package is not listed in the
know-conflicts-section.

12.1.1 Proved workarounds or recommendations for other packages
---------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of packages which are proved to work properly with ECB
and if not (i.e. there are conflicts) then helpful
solutions/hints/workarounds are offered:

12.1.1.1 Package bs.el
......................

The package bs.el offers a nifty buffer-selection buffer. The main
command of this package is `bs-show'. With ECB < 2.20 this command does
not really working well within activated ECB. But as of version 2.20 of
ECB there should be no problems using this package.

If you add "*buffer-selection*" as buffer-name to the option
`ecb-compilation-buffer-names' then ECB will always display the
buffer-selection buffer of bs in the compile-window (if there is one).
Otherwise bs will use the edit-area to do its job.

12.1.1.2 Package BBDB
.....................

As of ECB 2.21 there should be no conflicts between BBDB and ECB, so
BBDB can be used even when the ECB-windows are visible.

But if you encounter problems then it is recommened to use one of the
window-managers escreen.el or winring.el (*note Window-managers and
ECB::). With such a window-manager ECB and BBDB should work together
very well under all circumstances!

12.1.1.3 Package calendar.el
............................

With activated ECB `calendar' does not shrink itýs window to the small
size but splits the window equally. But if you add this to your
`.emacs' it works:

   (add-hook 'initial-calendar-window-hook
             (function (lambda ()
                         (when (and ecb-minor-mode
                                    (ecb-point-in-edit-window))
                           ;; if no horizontal split then nothing
                           ;; special to do
                           (or (= (frame-width) (window-width))
                               (shrink-window (- (window-height) 9))))
                        )))

12.1.1.4 Package cygwin-mount.el
................................

There can be a conflict between ECB and cygwin-mount.el if the
following conditions are true:

   - You are working with cygwin-mount.el (sounds clear :-)

   - You have set `cygwin-mount-build-mount-table-asynch' to not nil

   - ECB is automatically started after starting Emacs (e.g. with
     `ecb-auto-activate' or calling `ecb-activate' in
     `window-setup-hook')

   - Your Emacs-setup contains a call of `cygwin-mount-activate'.

Under these circumstances Emacs 21.X sometimes eats up the whole CPU (at
least with Windows XP) and the cygwin-mount-table is never build.

But there is an easy work-around: Call `cygwin-mount-activate' first
*AFTER* ECB is activated. This can be done with the hook
`ecb-activate-hook':

   (add-hook 'ecb-activate-hook
             (function (lambda ()
                         (require 'cygwin-mount)
                         (setq cygwin-mount-build-mount-table-asynch t)
                         (cygwin-mount-activate))))

12.1.1.5 Package desktop.el
...........................

ECB works perfectly with the desktop-saver desktop.el. Normally there
should be nothing to do for you.

But if you encounter problems (e.g. that desktop tries to activate ECB
for each buffer it loads) then you should add the following entry to
the option `desktop-minor-mode-table':

   (ecb-minor-mode nil)

If you still encounter problems then you should add entries for all the
minor-mode of the semantic-package to `desktop-minor-mode-table', so for
example add also:

   (semantic-decoration-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-completions-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-tag-highlight-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-summary-mode nil)
   (semantic-idle-scheduler-mode nil)
   (senator-isearch-semantic-mode nil)
   (senator-minor-mode nil)
   (semantic-highlight-func-mode nil)
   (semantic-stickyfunc-mode nil)
   (semantic-show-parser-state-mode nil)
   (semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode nil
   (semantic-highlight-edits-mode nil

Normally this should not be necessary, because semantic is already
prepared to work perfectly with desktop.el. But if there are problems
it's worth a try.  Which modes you have to add depends on which modes
of semantic you use. But to get sure you should add all minor-modes of
the semantic-package because these modes are normally activated by the
related "global" command (e.g.
`global-semantic-show-unmatched-syntax-mode') or by adding the
minor-mode to the related major-mode-hook.

It has also been reported that just disabling the Tip-Of-The-Day
(option: `ecb-tip-of-the-day') fixes the compatibility-problems with
desktop.el. Just try it out!

12.1.1.6 Package edebug (Lisp Debugger)
.......................................

It is strongly recommended to run edebug only when the ECB-windows are
hidden. With visible ECB-windows there will probably serious conflicts
between the ECB-layout and the edebug-window-manager.

12.1.1.7 Package ediff.el
.........................

In most cases ECB works very well with ediff (see option
`ecb-run-ediff-in-ecb-frame'). But currently suspending ediff with
`ediff-suspend' and restoring the ediff-session (e.g. with command
`eregistry') does confuse the window-management of ECB.

If you often use ediff in a scenario where you suspend ediff and
reactivate it later then it is recommended to exit ECB first
(`ecb-deactivate' or `ecb-minor-mode')!

12.1.1.8 Package func-menu.el
.............................

This package has been reported to produce some conflicts under some
circumstances when ECB is activated. Some of them could be reproduced
by the ECB-maintainer. So the recommendation is to disable
func-menu-support when using ECB. Normally using func-menu makes no
sense in combination with ECB because ECB provides the same and even
more informations as func-menu - so func-menu is redundant ;-)

12.1.1.9 Package Gnus (Newsreader)
..................................

As of ECB 2.21 there should be no conflicts between Gnus and ECB, so
Gnus can be used even when the ECB-windows are visible.

But if you encounter problems then it is recommened to use one of the
window-managers escreen.el or winring.el (*note Window-managers and
ECB::). With such a window-manager ECB and Gnus should work together
very well under all circumstances!

12.1.1.10 Package JDEE (Java Development Environment)
.....................................................

JDEE has a lot of "dialogs" where the user can select among several
choices. An example is importing classes via the command
`jde-import-find-and-import'. These dialogs are strongly designed to
work in an environment where a new temporary window is created, the
contents of the dialog are displayed in the new window, the user select
his choice and hits [OK]. After that the new window is deleted and the
selection is performed (for example the chosen import statement are
inserted in the source-buffer.

*Caution*: ECB can work very well with this dialogs but only if the
buffer-name of these dialog-buffers (normally "Dialog") is not
contained in the option `ecb-compilation-buffer-names'. So do not add
the string "Dialog" to this option!

*Please Note*: Regardless if a persistent compile-window is used (i.e.
`ecb-compile-window-height' is not nil) or not, these JDEE-dialogs will
always being displayed by splitting the edit-window of ECB and not
within the compile-window.

12.1.1.11 Package scroll-all.el (scroll-all-mode)
.................................................

ECB advices `scroll-all-mode' so it is working correct during running
ECB. This means if point stays in an edit-window and the edit-window is
splitted then all edit-windows are scrolled by `scroll-all-mode' and no
other window! If point stays in any other window just this selected
window is scrolled. This is the only senseful behavior of
`scroll-all-mode' with ECB.

12.1.1.12 Package VC (Version Control)
......................................

The variable `vc-delete-logbuf-window' must be set to nil during active
ECB. This can be done with the hooks mentioned in *note Elisp
programming::.

12.1.1.13 Package VM (Emacs Mail-Client)
........................................

As of ECB 2.21 there should be no conflicts between VM and ECB, so VM
can be used even when the ECB-windows are visible.

But if you encounter problems then it is recommened to use one of the
window-managers escreen.el or winring.el (*note Window-managers and
ECB::). With such a window-manager ECB and VM should work together very
well under all circumstances!

12.1.1.14 Package winner.el (winner-mode)
.........................................

`winner-mode' is autom. disabled as long as ECB is running. ECB has its
own window-management which is completely incompatible with
`winner-mode'! But `winner-mode' makes also not really sense with ECB.

12.1.1.15 Package wb-line-number.el
...................................

Do not use the package wb-line-number.el in combination with ECB - it
will not work and it will not work under any circumstances and there is
no way to make it work together and there will be no way in the future!

The reason behind that is: wb-line-number.el uses additional dedicated
windows to display the line-numbers. And ECB can not work if there
there are additional dedicated windows - additional to that ones
created by ECB.

12.1.1.16 Application xrefactory
................................

Xrefactory (also known as Xref, X-ref and Xref-Speller), the
refactoring browser for (X)Emacs(1), can be used during running ECB
regardless if the ECB-windows are visible or not. There should be no
conflicts as of ECB versions >= 2.21.

If there are conflicts with the Xref-browser then the most recommended
way is to use one of the window-manager escreen.el or winring.el (and
then use different escreens or window-configurations for ECB and
Xrefactory-browsing - *note Window-managers and ECB::).

12.1.2 What to do for unknown conflicts with other packages
-----------------------------------------------------------

As of version 2.20 the layout-engine of ECB is so flexible that
normally there should be no conflicts with other packages unless these
packages have their own complete window-layout-management (e.g. Gnus,
BBDB, Xrefactory). But these packages can and should be handled very
well with the window-manager-support of ECB (*note Window-managers and
ECB::).

So if you detect an unknown (i.e. not listed in the conflicts-list in
the next subsection) conflict with a small package and some of its
commands and you have installed an ECB-version < 2.20 the first task
you have to do is to upgrade to a version >= 2.20!

If this doesn't solve the problem a very probable reason for the
conflict is that the command fails if called from another window than
an edit-window of the ecb-frame. So please check if the problem
disappears if you call the failing command from an edit-window of ECB.
If this is true then you you can add the following code to your .emacs
(and of course replace the XXX with the failing command):

   (defecb-advice XXX before ecb-compatibility-advices
     "Ensures `XXX' works well when called from another window
   as an edit-window. Does nothing if called in another frame
   as the `ecb-frame'."
     (when (equal (selected-frame) ecb-frame)
       (unless (ecb-point-in-edit-window)
         (ecb-select-edit-window))))

This before-advice runs before the command XXX and ensures that the XXX
is called from within an edit-window if the current selected window is
not an edit-window. It does nothing if called for another frame as the
ecb-frame.

*Please note*: You have to define such compatibility advices exactly as
demonstrated in the example above, i.e. you must use the macro
`defecb-advice' and you have to use the advice-set
`ecb-compatibility-advices' (see the documentation of this macro)! The
advice-class is not necessary `before', it can be `after' or `around'
too. Never use `defadvice' for ECB-advices!

If such an advice solves the problem then please send a note with the
solution to the ECB-mailing-list or direct to the ECB-maintainer so the
solution can be integrated in the next ECB-release

If calling from an edit-window fails too then please file a complete
bug-report to the ECB-mailing-list (*note Submitting problem report::).
This report should contain a detailed description which command of
which package fails under which circumstances!

12.2 Known bugs
===============

This section describes all currently known bugs of ECB. The maintainers
of ECB try to fix these bugs as soon as possible.

12.2.1 Extra history-entries for JDEE source-buffers
----------------------------------------------------

ECB on occasions creates an extra edit buffer for entries in the
history window. For example, let say there are three entries in the
history window:

   Test1
   Test2
   Test3

In the edit window Test1 file is edited. When clicked on Test2 entry in
history, on occasion instead of switching to the existing buffer for
Test2, a new edit buffer is opened for Test2 file. At this point, there
are four entries in the history as follows:

   Test2
   Test2<2>
   Test1
   Test3

                                This can be done with the hooks of ECB.

Does ECB support C++ as well    In general C++ is supported very well.
as Java?                        But it depends on the used cedet-version,
                                but cedet-version >= 1.0pre6 support C++
                                really well.

Does ECB support Perl?          If perl can be parsed either by imenu,
                                etags or semantic then ECB supports perl.
                                Of course ECB would support perl best if
                                perl is supported by semantic.

                                automatically support language XYZ!
                                There is nothing to do in ECB itself!
                                Same when you write an imenu- or
                                etags-support for language XYZ.

Why does ECB not recognize      Your C++-files have probably an extension
my source-files for C++?        which is not mapped to c++-mode in
                                `auto-mode-alist' and/or your own
                                Emacs-setup has "destroyed" the correct
                                value of the hook-variable

Is it possible to make the      You can use the library "desktop.el"
history of ECB persistent?      which works very well with ECB.  Then all
                                files of your recent Emacs-session will
                                be opened automatically after next

                                automatically to the ECB-history after
                                ECB-start.

Is there an                     For Java the JDEE(1) has this feature and
"Intellisense"-mechanism        for all other languages semantic offer
like with other IDEs?           something similar, see
                                `http://cedet.sourceforge.net/intellisense.shtml'

Can i use ECB in combination    You can, but for ECB-versions < 1.96 it
with Gnus within one frame?     is not recommended because each of them
                                has it's own window-management and
                                probably there will be conflicts, so use
                                different frames for ECB and Gnus! But
                                beginning with ECB 1.96 you can use
                                either escreen.el or winring.el as
                                "window-manager" which allows you in
                                consequence to use ECB and applications
                                like Gnus in one frame!
