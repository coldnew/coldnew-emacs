#+TITLE:An Org-mode buffer management tool

The function `org-buffers-list' creates a read-only Org-mode buffer
populated with links to currently open buffers. By default, buffers
are grouped by major mode. Buffers can be flagged for deletion (d),
revert (r) and pending operations executed (x), in a similar way to
dired and buffer-menu-mode.

Type "?" to see all available actions, and also see the org-mode
Customize group "org-buffers". Some variables that can be configured are

- org-buffers-buffer-properties
- org-buffers-excluded-modes
- org-buffers-excluded-buffers
- org-buffers-follow-link-method
- org-buffers-mode-hook
- org-buffers-buffer-name
- org-buffers-switch-to-buffer-function

* Bugs [32/37]
*** TODO Come on github, turn me into html!
*** TODO when deleting many keep in sensible state even if back out half way
    e.g. you might back out when alerted that modified and asked if
    you want to save.
*** TODO Column view
***** TODO Need to disable things when entering colview and reenable when exiting
***** TODO d in columns-view deletes everything but current
*** TODO Why are all org files being opened sometimes?

    I.e. as if agenda had been called
    'Getting targets...'
*** TODO Point movement with g in lines mode
    because heading search target is above point
    Solving this would require searching for line rather than heading.
*** DONE selected all buffers in subtree, d, x and heading didn't go
*** DONE Before first heading mode when flat view -> colview
*** DONE Fix toggling headings in flat mode bug
*** PROPOSED deleting last buffer in flat mode caused error
    if: Args out of range: 864, 1118
    can't recreate this?
*** DONE Keybindings conflicts
***** We are over-riding speed commands
***** E.g. p conflicts with p in / dispatcher.
***** Conflicts with column-view keys
*** DONE delete last entry in buffer when region active
*** DONE Don't jump to non-existent buffer
*** DONE all properties exposed after using :by
    C-x k *Buffers*
    C-x C-b
    ,
    b
    de RET

    dirname -> major-mode
*** DONE Set tag if region encompasses part of one line only
    Currently does in lines mode but not in headings mode
*** DONE stop region taking too much
*** DONE stop deleting whole subtrees
*** DONE I got NONE as only property once
    This is when use b without properties present in buffer. I believe
    getting into this state is a bug caused by error (usually a
    before-first-heading error) and so should be fixed.
*** DONE Grouping by property that can be nil screws up
*** DONE point movement when inserting properties
    when grouped by major mode, put point on first level 1 heading ,
    p, point moves down to level 2.
*** DONE Column view needs to get rid of buffer-read-only
*** DONE Don't show all on flat view
*** DONE before first heading when list:flat
*** DONE Should get rid of properties when moving to lines mode?
*** No such buffer nil on RET to deleted
    This error message from org-open-at-point
*** Compare details of region selection with other modes
*** How to check for current minor modes?
    Ratheer than testing buffer name
*** DONE overzealous -mode chomping hook function
*** DONE Point movement when properties
*** DONE D in line mode sets on first of region only
*** DONE d on single line causes previous one to get tag also
*** DONE %20 in buffer name
*** DONE Deleting last 4 caused text screw up
*** DONE Tags can be hard to line up with buffers
*** DONE Tags for deletion [3/3]
***** DONE Deletes alternates
***** DONE Needs active region
***** DONE Executing pending doesn't work first time
*** DONE Stop hijacking keys in other org buffers
*** DONE Make tags visible
*** CANCELLED Stop buffer links over-riding file links
    and yet make them usable.
    I've set them not to store on org-store-link
*** CANCELLED Add context to buffer links
    Can use [[file:/usr/local/src/emacs/org-mode-core/lisp/org.el::org%20make%20org%20heading%20search%20string%20txt][this]] for org buffers. I'm leaving this for now.
*** CANCELLED Don't use props for b-m-p? just tags
*** CANCELLED Get rid of newline at eob
