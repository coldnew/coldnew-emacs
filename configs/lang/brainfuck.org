[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck][Brainfuck]] is an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language][esoteric programming language]] created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pointer][instruction pointer]]. While it is fully [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing-complete][Turing-complete]], it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmers][programmers]].

The language's name is a reference to the slang term "brain fuck", which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.
